# 4.2 Numbers, Letters, Variable Assignments

## Release 1

* What does puts do?
* What is an integer? What is a float?
* What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

The method puts (short for put string) prints a string of the output given to the console along with a new line.

An integer is a whole number without any decimals. A float, on the other hand, is a number with decimals.

Float division allows you to divide two float numbers--numbers with decimals--the output of which will include any decimal numbers (i.e. 5/2 => 2.5). Integer division divides whole numbers without the decimals, the output of which is also a whole number rounded down (i.e. 9/2 => 4).
