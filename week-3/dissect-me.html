	<h3>Git?</h3>

	<p>Have you ever had an idea for your software project only for it to break the project as a whole? Sure you can revert back to an earlier saved version (with your VCS), but then you'd lose all the work you put into the new feature. Luckily, there's a better way!</p>

	<p>Use Git as your VCS and it's easy to make "branches" to try out new features without accidentally breaking the whole project! You'll be able to have a separate branch for every new feature you want to add - and they won't interfere with each other! All without risking the health of your current working branch!</p>

	<h3>New Beginnings</h3>

	<p>Before we begin, I feel the need to lay a foundation of understanding between us. My journey, as many fledgling developers before me, started in the command line. So, while many might be accustomed to colorful graphical interfaces and buttons, and cursors, as a developer we are taught to maneuver among a computer's inner bits (literally), through the use of typed out commands inside a drab black box called a shell or bash. This affords us some benefits, the ability to see clearly the directory (just a fancy way of saying a folder) we're currently in and be able to make changes much quicker and efficiently without having to lift a single finger from the keyboard and touch that germ-covered mouse or trackpad. This visualization is important because as you'll see shortly, certain programs can affect the way we see the bash and the commands we can use. But now I digress...</p>
