	<h3>Git?</h3>

	<p>Have you ever had an idea for your software project only for it to break the project as a whole? Sure you can revert back to an earlier saved version (with your VCS), but then you'd lose all the work you put into the new feature. Luckily, there's a better way!</p>

	<p>Use Git as your VCS and it's easy to make "branches" to try out new features without accidentally breaking the whole project! You'll be able to have a separate branch for every new feature you want to add - and they won't interfere with each other! All without risking the health of your current working branch!</p>

	<h3>New Beginnings</h3>

	<p>Before we begin, I feel the need to lay a foundation of understanding between us. My journey, as many fledgling developers before me, started in the command line. So, while many might be accustomed to colorful graphical interfaces and buttons, and cursors, as a developer we are taught to maneuver among a computer's inner bits (literally), through the use of typed out commands inside a drab black box called a shell or bash. This affords us some benefits, the ability to see clearly the directory (just a fancy way of saying a folder) we're currently in and be able to make changes much quicker and efficiently without having to lift a single finger from the keyboard and touch that germ-covered mouse or trackpad. This visualization is important because as you'll see shortly, certain programs can affect the way we see the bash and the commands we can use. But now I digress...</p>

<!--
* What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

- The <article> tag, because it's very useful when denoting a blog post or news article. Structurally it's also very common since it is best used with a heading, it can be easy to plan for the most important parts of your site.

* How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

- Elements get laid out from top to bottom and any tags nested within other tags will simply be laid at the bottom of the parent tag. So for example, a header at the top of the file, with nav links will be displayed on top of an article that then contains a heading and a paragraph. If there is an aside tag after the article it will then be displayed at the bottom, after the article content (heading and paragraph).

* What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

- Sublime is so userful, I was amazed at how easy it was to create a snippet. I will definitely keep this in mind and continue to create snippets. Shortcus will also aid me and navigating and editing files quicker, so I will definitely be researching those.
