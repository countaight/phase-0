 // Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself, with: ]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.

var adam = {};
adam.name = "Adam";
terah.spouse = adam;
terah.weight = 125;
delete terah.eyeColor;
adam.spouse = terah;
terah.children = {};
terah.children.carson = {};
terah.children.carson.name = "Carson";
terah.children.carter = {};
terah.children.carter.name = "Carter";
terah.children.colton = {};
terah.children.colton.name = "Colton";
adam.children = terah.children;

// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines
//
// What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?
//   I had some trouble passing the tests relating to the children. I was originally trying to add the name and the child in one line but it was telling me that the property wasn't valid for a none existant object. I passed it by first creating an empty object with the property name being the child, then went ahead and added the name property to that. That worked, because originally, JavaScript can't tell what you're trying to add as a property value (i.e. objects) unless it has previously been created.

// How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?
//   Surprisingly, not at all difficult. Simple dot notation, or like in Ruby bracket notation, followed by the assigning operator "=" does the trick.

// What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?
// I learned to be careful when creating objects within objects, and their usefulness in being nested. It is also important to have valid variable names as properties if you would like to use them in dot notation, otherwise, bracket notation is required to access those values.
