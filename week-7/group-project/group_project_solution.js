// As a user I want to use a function "sum" to take all the numbers in a list and add them together.
// As a user I want to use a function "mean" to get the mathematical average from a list of numbers by adding all the numbers on the list together and dividing by the amount of numbers on that list.
// As a user I want to use a function "median" to get the middle number from a list of numbers that has been sorted from the smallest number to the biggest number. If there are an even amount of numbers on the list I want to know the average of the two middle numbers.
