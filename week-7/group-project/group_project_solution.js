// As a student I want to "sum" the numbers on a list so that I can add together any amount of numbers together.
// As a student I want to get the "mean", or mathematical average from a list of numbers.
// As a student I want to get the "median", or middle number, from a set of numbers. I should be able to get a median no matter what the size of the list is.


// Tests 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9 passed. Tests 2, 3, 5, 6 did not pass.
// I believe the test failed because the functions did not return anything.
