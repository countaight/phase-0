#1.1 Think About Time

The topic of time management and productivity has always seemed largely foreign to me. I recognize that it is a widely popular topic, especially in business and project management, as evident by the numerous articles and books that are written about it. Personally, I employ a very lax strategy when it comes to time management and productivity. That being said, my strategy does have its clear shortcomings. For one I feel like certain important tasks don't get done, or simple little mundane tasks simply get pushed until I have a rather large pile of small tasks. While I skimmed through articles here and there, the articles and videos provided here have really given me a wider scope of the ideas that are available.

Some of the ideas I like the best involved non-conventional methods, such as the tips outlined in the blog post [Seven Counterintuitive Ways to be Insanely Productive](https://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity/). The blog post's tips deal with ways to use "procrastination time" as times of producing something you can appreciate or be proud of. Ultimately, he suggests to forget productivity all together and focus on the cyclical nature and curious nature of humans to want to learn and eventually do the things that need to be done. 

The Fogg Method and in conjunction Fogg's video Tiny Habits, focused on using our aversion to hard work which requires high levels of motivation to create tiny feasible habits that can in turn change into long term habits. As it relates to project management, this will be useful in order to create working habits that can be triggered by seemingly mundane things. This is definitely a method I will employ during my time at DBC.

Another interesting idea is the "time boxing" strategy. Basically this is a way of organizing tasks or a group of tasks into a set amount of time in which that task will be worked on whether it's completed or not. This method is very interesting because it could potentially tackle the problem I have with small tasks accumulating. With Time Boxing I can set a small window frame of time to complete one or a few of the tasks I have without having to stress about its completion, simply the task is assessed at the end of the time allotment and I move on.

Overall, I feel that the articles, blog posts, and videos employed a very, "don't beat yourself up" attitude, and I can definitely appreciate that. Old conventions of putting in hard work which could ultimately lead to stress are abandoned for more, reward yourself for the small things you achieve, create a sense of difficulty and curiosity to entice your mind, and ultimately productivity is what you make of it.

My time management plan then, is to create "time boxes" for the challenges, and work on them as my curiosity and interest are piqued. I will take small breaks and reward myself by doing something else I love, such as Origami, playing the piano, or reading something else. This will keep my mind fresh and wanting more out of the learning experience at DBC.

#1.2 The Command Line

The command line, or shell, is the program on the computer that links the programmer to the computer's inner-workings, in essence, the shell is the interpreter between the programmer and the computer. The shell is created or set with a series of commands that the computer can understand in order to execute various instructions. These sets of commands and rules can be specific to a particular type of shell, for example, "bash". BASH is a type of shell or interpreter that contains its own commands that allows a programmer to communicate with the computer. One of the most challenging things to understand is this distinction between a shell and a bash, although used interchangeably, there are some commands that might work in one shell but not another. As it stands, I was able to run all the commands which included:

pwd - this command prints the current working directory

ls - lists the current working directory's files

mv - this command can be used to move one file from one directory to another or to rename files and directories

cd - which stands for "change directory" allows one to change the current working directory

../ - allows one to move up in the directory, from the current directory (folder) to the one that contains it (or parent directory)

touch - typing this command followed by a name and extension (.rb, or .txt etc) will create a file of that type in the current working directory

mkdir - the command for creating folders/directories in the working directory

less - allows the programmer to see a "page" of a file, such as a text file

rmdir - is used to destroy or remove a directory

rm - allows for the removal of the named file

help - when typed, this command displays some of the various commands and their respective allowed arguments 

One of the most helpful commands, I found, is the help command or the argument --h. Certain other helpful commands, such as ls (to list the items in the current directory) or mkdir (to create a folder/directory), really benefit from the argument --h, this pops up the various options that are available to the programmer. For example, ls --h reveals that there is an option -l that will long list the contents of the directory in a long list format with the permissions of the files, the owner, group, size and even date of when it was last modified.
