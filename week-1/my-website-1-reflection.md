A new repository can be created on www.github.com by clicking on the plus "+" sign on the top right corner of the page. The user will then be presented with a form with several fields and options for creating the new repository. First, a name should be given to the repository. There's also an optional text box to include a description of the repository. Finally, the user has the option of making the repository either private or public, include a README file (a file that can contain information about the repository and/or a manual in the case of software), and include additional files and licenses. The last step is to simply click "Create Repository", which should immediately send the user to their account and their newly created repository.

The great thing about an online repository is that it is the perfect place to house all the files to a project, such as a new application or program, and make it easily accessible for others to collaborate, enhance, and improve it. Doing so is in the spirit of open source. Open source is the free speech of the tech world. An attitude of free collaboration in the name of technological growth. In practice, open source offers several licensing options to protect the original content creator, but also encourage sharing, distribution, and updating of programs or any digital content.

All the positive experiences I've had with developers, programmers, and really any tech aficionado up to this point have all revolved around their willingness to provide help freely. This has only conviced me to adopt an attitude similar to the attitude behind open source. Given the many advances in technology already achieved through open source, the idea makes me excited for the future ahead. If there are any reservations at all, it's that indeed one should protect their work as strongly as possible while still keeping that air of free collaboration.

Fortunately, that's where licensing comes in. Licenses are the stated permissions for content that specify what is allowed and disallowed when it comes to changes and distribution. More lax licenses such as the GNU General Public License, for example, allow unlimited copying, modifying, and distribution of content and software, under the condition that the borrowed content also be released under the same license. Again this helps the content stay open and free to evolve.

This challenge really solidified by knowledge of the workflow. I found the importance of creating separate branches to keep my original work clean. I can also visualize future workflow that might involve peer review of my code or files and how that might tie in to my projects.

To further understand the concept of open source I wanted to learn more about its advantages and disavantages. For that I found this website, http://www.moneycrashers.com/free-open-source-software-definition/ . I found it interesting that there's actually a slight contrast between open and free source, but more so, I found it amazing how conscientous the technology community can be.
