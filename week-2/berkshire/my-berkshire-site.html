- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

It was definitely very exiciting seeing my work come to life as I placed text into HTML tags. It also put into perspective how crucial it is to keep sections separated by naming them as accurately as possible.

Researching and using HTML5 semantic elements was super easy, there are so many resources out there and they're very detailed. W3Schools has a great searchable database.

I can see why it would be very tempting to try and add styling to the text, but I would say, having a clear picture of the wireframe and visualizing the site as sections and boxes, really helps keep that placement/semantics mentality.

HTML seems great at maintaining the structure and foundation of the site. I imagine it's the wireframe of the code files. It's also very easy to debug, errors are very visible and easy to spot. It's drawbacks, however, include, too many versions of HTML, some of which are not supported by certain browsers. And although tags are easy to remember, some are very lengthy and involved when it comes to more complicated projects.

One Trick I have for remembering how to write HTML is to first visualize the basic components of the site and work my way in. HEAD and BODY are in HTML or ARTICLEs are in SECTIONs, ASIDE is placed aside, so on and so forth. Once you get to the smallest components such as paragraphs and some of the more lengthy tags like links or images, simple memorizaiton will do, or just keep practicing.
